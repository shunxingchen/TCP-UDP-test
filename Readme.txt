There are two java files, one is 'TcpUdpTest.java' that is client class. Server class is 'TcpUdpServer.java'. You can compile them by javac again, or just download all compiled classes from 'bin'.


to run the test application, just open CMD, then type 'java TcpUdpTest port'

port 7 - RFC862

port 13 - RFC867

port 37 - RFC868
